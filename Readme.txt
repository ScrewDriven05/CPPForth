This is my own attempt at writing a Forth interpreter from (almost) scratch in C++. 

Now I am aware that there are multiple, far superior libraries available for a lot of the stuff that I am 
implementing from the ground up, (such as dictionaries, dynamic arrays, etc.) but this is also a 
self-imposed practice exercise for my DSA course which requires us to do stuff like this.

Final goals with the project will be to create a GUI in either Qt with C++ or Tkinter in Python, and to
create a version that will be ported to an STM32 based standalone device.
